Cloud computing architecture Refers to the componant and subscomponants that needed in cloud computing.
Cloud computing is mainly consist of FrontEnd, BackEnd, Service delivery and internet.

There is many compoanant and subcomponant of the cloud computing but we can broadly divide them into
2 main parts : Frontend and backend. Both end is connected to the each other over the network by the
internet.

Frontend:-

Frontend refers to the client side Graphic represantation of the cloud computing by which client can
easily use the cloud services.

Backend:-

Backend refers to the cloud itself. It contains Storage, Virtualization, Security, Managment, Application,
cloud runtime and its infrastructure. In backend we manage the services of the cloud to faciticate end
user and it is responsibily of the backend to provide security and protocols to the cloud.

here are some sub componant of the backend briefly described..

(1) Security : Security is mainly handled by the backend using protocals to secure the communication
and data exchange between client and cloud server.

(2) Storage : Storage mean the place where we store users data.

(3) Application : In this backend use business logics to handle the application and store users data.

(4) cloud runtime : Cloud runtime is the place used by the cloud to run Virtual machines and other hypervisor
application and provide runtime environment to them.

(5) Infrastructure : Infratructure means hardwares and softwares that we required for cloud computing such as
Operation systems ,Physical servers ,etc.

(6) Managment : In this phase , we manage all the componants to work together and do intented task.
