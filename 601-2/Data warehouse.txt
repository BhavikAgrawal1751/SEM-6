Dataware house also called as EDW (enterprise data warehouse).
It is system that collect the data from variouse souces into single and central database.
It allows organization to analize huge volume of data in way the standerd database can not do.
It is further used for AI, Data Analysis and data mining.
The goal of data warehouse is to produce statical data that helps the organization for decision making.

Dataware house is generally divided into three tier architecture.
(1) Botton tier
-> Consite of server and database system which collect, clean and transform the data from various resources.
-> For that is have process called as ELT or ETL which stands for Extraction Load and transform.

(2) Middle tier
-> Consist of OLAP server which stands for Online Anlytical Processing.
-> It provide fast query speed to extract the data in meaningfull information.
-> OLAP have 3 modals : MOLAP,HOLAP and ROLAP. This modal depends of the server's database system

(3) Top tier
-> Consist of front-end tools which allows end users to conduct analytics for the data.

== OLAP ==
OLAP (online analytical processing) is a computing method that enables users to easily and selectively extract and query data in order to analyze it from different points of view. OLAP business intelligence queries often aid in trends analysis, financial reporting, sales forecasting, budgeting and other planning purposes

== OLTP ==
OLTP or Online Transaction Processing is a type of data processing that consists of executing a number of transactions occurring concurrentlyâ€”online banking, shopping, order entry, or sending text messages, for example. These transactions traditionally are referred to as economic or financial transactions, recorded and secured so that an enterprise can access the information anytime for accounting or reporting purposes.

OLAP vs OLTP
-------------

(1) full form
(2) volume :
	-> Large volume of short online data in TB or PB
	-> Relatively low volume for transaction. 

(3) Purpose :
	-> extract information for analysis and decision-making.
	-> store crud operation information

(4) Queries :
	-> Complex aggregation queries and very slower then OLTP
	-> simple and easy queries and paster then OLAP

(5) Storing manner :
	-> Store data in unstructured ,semi structured or in structured manner as well.
	-> Stores only Structured data.

(6) Normalization :
	-> Tables are not normalized.
	-> Tables are normalized according to 3NF.

(7) Backups :
	-> Needed time to time backup then OLTP.
	-> Regular backup needed mandatory.
