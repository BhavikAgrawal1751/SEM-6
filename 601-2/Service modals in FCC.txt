there is three type of cloud service modals.

(1)IaaS
(2)PaaS
(3)SaaS

(1)IaaS : 
-> Infrastructure as a service
-> IaaS provides infratructure means Data storage , Virtualisation,
Operating System, Hypervisor, Network configurations and other things
to handle.
-> IaaS have over all control over all the network and suitable for
IT administrators.
-> It follows pay-for-what-you-use modal.

Example : Supose we want home to stay then puchasing home is costly
so just we can rent any home by the medieter for some time and we will
only pay for the time we used home.

(2)PaaS :
-> Platform as a service
-> PaaS provides the runtime environment for the application and various tools and services
to handle development , debuging and testing.
-> Platform as a Service (PaaS) typically follows a subscription-based pricing model. 
-> In PaaS every thing that we need to handle the cloud is provided by the vendors.
-> We dont have control on data storage ,Network and other things.We just have a access
to the platform which is given by the Vendors to work on it such as application
and its data.
-> It is suitable for developers who test and debug the application and modify the application
according to the vendors need.

Example : Suppose we have the local website and want to publish on the server so we can just 
buy the Cloud platform to run our application according to the language and others like data storage
Operating system will be handled by the IT admins (Vendors).

(3) SaaS:
-> Software as a service
-> In SaaS everthing is managed by the cloud service provider we just need to internet to manage
the application which is avilable to the end user. 
-> It follows pay as you go model.
-> In this we dont have control to the data storage server runtime network and it is managed by the
cloud service provider it self.
-> It is mainly suitable for the end users or Client.

Example : Gmail is google's software that provided to us we just need to create account and manage the setting
to use the services over the internet.
